# Compute-a-fibonacci-series-using-queue-data-structure
I have written a small c code that will compute the Fibonacci series using queue data structure.
I have implemented queue usiing linked list to make it dynamic for user so that he/she can esily set up limits upto which he/she wants to print the series..
